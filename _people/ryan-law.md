bio: I am broadly interested in how language constructs and convey meaning. Previously, I worked as a research assistant at New York University Abu Dhabi. I have a BA in Linguistics from UCL. There, I explored my interests in psycholinguistics, experimental pragmatics, and language development through working in psychology and linguistics laboratories in the UK and the US.
