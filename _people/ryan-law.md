bio: My primary interest is meaning in the brain&#58; the nature of its representation and how it is constructed and conveyed. Previously, I worked as a research assistant at New York University Abu Dhabi, where I studied the brain bases of syntax using MEG. I have a Bachelors degree in Linguistics from UCL. During which, I explored my interests in psycholinguistics, experimental pragmatics, and language development through working in psychology and linguistics laboratories in the UK and the US.
