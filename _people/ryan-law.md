bio: In addition to maintaining daily lab functioning, I conduct and assist in research on speech and language processing using a variety of behavioural and neuroimaging techniques, such as magnetoenchephalography (MEG). I am broadly interested in how language constructs and conveys meaning. Currently, I am pursuing a Research Master's in Cognitive Neuroscience at the Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition and Behaviour. Previously, my research as a predoctoral research assistant at New York University Abu Dhabi explored the neural basis of syntactic and discourse processing using MEG. I earned a BA in Linguistics from UCL. There, I explored my interests in linguistic theory, psycholinguistics, and developmental psychology through working in psychology and linguistics laboratories in the UK and the US.
