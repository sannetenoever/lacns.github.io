bio: I am Karthikeya R Kaushik, a Research Assistant working with Dr. Andrea Martin on the formal and computational aspects of language comprehension. For my Master's thesis completed this year at the TU Munich (in Computational Science and Engineering), I worked on a formalism of compositionality and structure dependence in natural language, which will be the focus of my research at the LaCNS. I also work as a RA at the Crowd Cognition lab at LMU, Munich, where I study homophily in social networks in matters of taste.
