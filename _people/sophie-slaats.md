bio: ï»¿I am a PhD student in the Psychology of Language Department at the MPI. My research focus is the interaction between levels of linguistic representation during spoken language comprehension. I am intrigued by the way our brain infers hierarchical structure and meaning from sound sequences, and how knowledge of these higher levels in turn affect lower-level perception. Previously, I obtained bachelors in Linguistics and Spanish philology, and a masters in Linguistics at the University of Utrecht, and a masters in the Cognitive Neuroscience of Language at the Basque Center on Cognition, Brain and Language.
