bio: I am a postdoctoral researcher in the Language and Computation in Neural System group at the DCCN. My interest for language processing grew during my PhD at Imperial College London and from a general interest in information processing in dynamical systems. My research focused primarily in the predictive aspect of language processing, and how we could extract robust measures underpinning speech comprehension from continuous EEG recordings. Currently, building on this previous work, I am developing analysis methods to assess how composition of structures and meaning arose during naturalistic comprehension. Departing from MEG and EEG activity, a focus on oscillatory and spectro-temporal dynamics will foster the development of computational models to discover putative mechanisms for composition in the brain.
