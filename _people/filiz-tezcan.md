bio: I am a Ph.D. student in the Language and Computation in Neural Systems Research Group at the MPI for Psycholinguistics. My research interest is the computational mechanisms of language comprehension; how sound patterns are transformed into complex meanings and what is the role of neural oscillations. I got my MA degree in Cognitive Science at Yeditepe University, Istanbul where I studied the recognition of harmonic sound sequences and the effect of temporal ordering in understanding the perception of sound events with electrophysiological and behavioral experiments.
