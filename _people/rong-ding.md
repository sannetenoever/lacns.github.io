bio: I'm a PhD student based at the MPI for Psycholinguistics starting from October, 2020. My goal of research is to dissect the way(s) neuronal populations communicate and coordinate in time as well as how our marvellous capacity of language is achieved by such neuronal interactions. Profoundly inspired by György Buzsáki's Rhythms of the Brain (2005), I'm keen to probe into the neuronal dynamics of language function from the perspectives of oscillation and the complex systems theory. My fascination in brain and language started with the cross-disciplinary undergraduate training I received in the B.S. Psychology and B.A. Indonesian Language and Culture programs at Peking University. To pursue such passion even further, I completed a M.Sc. in Language Sciences at University College London, wherein I learned to conduct research by incorporating methods from various subjects—that is, computational modelling, EEG, and the naturalistic experimental paradigm—and examined the neurophysiological correlates of predictive coding (word surprisal) in audiovisual speech comprehension.
