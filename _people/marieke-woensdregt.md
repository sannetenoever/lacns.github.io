bio: I (she/her) am a postdoc working with Andrea Martin in the LaCNS group, and Iris van Rooij and Mark Blokpoel in the Computational Cognitive Science group at Radboud University. During this postdoc, I will develop a computational model of fast and flexible linguistic inference, taking into account plausibility constraints based on both (i) what we know about how the brain works, and (ii) what the brain (or any computational system) can do with limited resources (in terms of time and memory). More generally, I am a computational cognitive scientist, and I use computational modelling to investigate language and how it interacts with social cognition and social interaction, both on the timescale of conversation, as well as the timescale of cultural evolution. Before my postdoc at LaCNS, I did a postdoc on the role of social cognition in referential communication with Paula Rubio-Fern√°ndez and Julian Jara-Ettinger at the University of Oslo. Before that, a postdoc on the interaction between language and metacommunication (e.g. repair and backchannels) across conversation and cultural evolution, with Mark Dingemanse at Radboud University. And prior to that, I did a PhD on the cultural co-evolution of language and mindreading, under supervision of Simon Kirby, Kenny Smith and Chris Cummins, at the University of Edinburgh.
