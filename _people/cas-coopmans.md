bio: I am a PhD student in the Neurobiology of Language department at the MPI and the Grammar and Cognition group of the Centre for Language Studies at Radboud University. I have a bachelor’s degree in Psychology from Utrecht University, and a master’s degree in Cognitive Neuroscience from Radboud University Nijmegen. My primary research interest lies at the intersection of theoretical linguistics, psycholinguistics, and cognitive neuroscience – specifically that part of the intersection that deals with our knowledge and representation of syntax. In my research, I use both behavioral and neuroscientific methods (EEG, MEG) in order to study how we infer hierarchically structured (syntactic) representations from linearly structured, word-by-word language input. My ultimate aim is to use the results of these psycholinguistic experiments to inform theoretical debates about the nature of syntactic representations, thereby helping to bridge the divide between linguistics and psycholinguistics.
