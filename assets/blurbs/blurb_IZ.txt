Ioanna Zioga

I am a postdoctoral researcher at the Donders Centre for Cognitive Neuroimaging co-mentored by Andrea E. Martin and Saskia Haegens, under the Language in Interaction project (https://www.languageininteraction.nl/BigQuestion5.html). I am interested to investigate lower-level brain mechanisms on higher-level functions, such as creativity, using MEG. 

My PhD research at Queen Mary University of London with Caroline Di Bernardi Luft focused on the neural correlates of learning and creativity in the domains of language semantics and artificial music grammars.

Previously I completed my first postdoctoral position at Queen Mary University investigating brain-to-brain synchronization during EEG hyperscanning and eye-tracking.
