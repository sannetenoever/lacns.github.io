I am a PhD student in the Psychology of Language Department at the MPI. By using M/EEG, my Ph.D. projects mainly focus on exploring the neural mechanisms of the neural representation of hierarchical linguistic structures. Under the supervision of Dr. Andrea Martin and Prof. Dr. Antje Meyer, we will also test the role of probability information in speech perception.
