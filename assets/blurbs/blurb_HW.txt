I am a postdoctoral researcher in the Language and Computation in Neural System group at the DCCN. My interest for language processing grew during my PhD at Imperial College London and from a general interest in information processing in dynamical systems. My research focused primarly in the predictive aspect of language processing, and how we could extract robust measures underpinning speech cmoprehension from continuous EEG recordings. Currently, building on this previous work, I am developping analysis methods to assess how composition of structures and meaning arose druing naturalistic comprehension. Departing from MEG and EEG activity, a focus on oscilaltory and spectro-temporal dynamics will foster the developpement of computational models to discover putative mechanisms for composition in the brain.
